BETAHIST.TXT - HISTORY OF GRPICON 2.0 BETA CHANGES

Outstanding issues:
(256 color) Windows are painted twce when switching
Switching away from Progman can trash 256 color bitmap display.

04/05/92	Update 4 - Cleaned up more of the palette code.  Switching between two Groups both
		containing 256 color images would not always cause a palette change, resulting in
		incorrect colors.  Fixed a bug that caused the PMGroup menu to be damaged if a Group
		was deleted.

03/21/92	Update 3 - Program would crash if icon file had bad header information.  Made the
		detection code a little smarter.  Also fixed a bug that would cause program to
		incorrectly determine the number of colors in the palette when using a 32k or higher
		color palette.

03/19/92	Update 2 - Fixed problem that prevented you from creating new Groups while GI was
		running (don't try it with earlier releases!)
		Updated files for this release: GRPICON.EXE.

03/18/92 	Update 1 - Made program start hidden, added 'Hide' menu option.  Changed one line
		in icon recognition code that caused Norton Desktop .NIL files not to be recognized.
		Fixed custom menu text problem.  Changes in system colors (i.e. Control Panel color
		change) should work now.  GrpIcon menu options now work when a Group is maximized.
		Updated files for this release: GRPICON.EXE, NWS.DLL.

03/17/92	Initial Beta Release - See GIBETA.DOC/WRI for details.
