When GrpIcon is started, you will not see any icon appear for it.  
This is because GrpIcon's mission is to make your Windows Program Manager act 
just like it had the ability to customize Group windows all along, so all of 
GrpIcon's functions are accessible directly from Program Manager whenever
GrpIcon is running.  

Just click on the Control Menu (also known as the System Menu) of any 
Program Manager Group window, or press Alt-minus with the keyboard to open 
the Control Menu of the active Program Manager Group.  You will see a new, 
colorful menu item entitled "Group Properties".  Select the new 
"Group Properties" menu item, and another snazzy menu will appear which 
allows you to access the various GrpIcon features.  

From here on in, have fun, experiment, and if you have questions, 
consult the on-line Help, which is available by clicking on the Help button 
in any GrpIcon dialog box.  If your question is not answered by the on-line 
Help, give us a call at (617) 536-6946, and ask for Technical Support.

Enjoy!

P.S.	ATTENTION WINDOWS 3.0 USERS!!!!!!
Although GrpIcon works identically under Windows 3.0 and 3.1, the Windows 3.1
files COMMDLG.DLL and WINHELP.EXE are required for GrpIcon to function properly.
In order to keep the size of the package small, these files are not distributed
with GrpIcon, as they are readily available from a variety of sources.  If you
do not have copies of these files, please contact Kenny at (617) 536-6946 and we
will arrange to get the files to you.
